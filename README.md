# SiteFilters

Blocks ads and placeholders, cookie alerts, site annoyances.

Works best with cookies & site data cleared for all websites.

Been noticing heavy RAM usage with YouTube when using the cosmetic filters. Might remove some.

Could also be a problem with EasyPrivacy and/or AdGuard Tracking Protection blocking > one thousand tracking elements on a single tab such as a youtube live stream.

If your loading looks like this:

That's normal. It's caused by *##*:style(animation-timing-function: step-start !important;transition-timing-function: step-start !important;)

And it's to stop sites loading slowly when scrolling down because I don't care about html 6.0 just let me read your stuff

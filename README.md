# SiteFilters
Blocks ads and placeholders, cookie alerts, site annoyances.

Works best with cookies & site data cleared for all websites.

Been noticing heavy RAM usage with YouTube when using the cosmetic filters. Might remove some.

Could also be a problem with EasyPrivacy and/or AdGuard Tracking Protection blocking > one thousand tracking elements on a single tab such as a youtube live stream.
